# <Text Edit pwa >

## Description

My motivation was to create an offline pwa text editor to use when unable to connect to online. 
This can solve issues of not being able to connect to the internet or go online when meeting to use a text editor you have but requires online.
This project has given me a deeper look into Pwas.
